The point of this book isn’t to give a detailed explanation of programming language syntax, but to show solid examples of programs that perform an actual activity, whether it’s a card game, an animation, or exploration of a mathematical puzzle. As such, I recommend the following steps:

1. Download the program and run it to see what the program does for yourself.

2. Starting from a blank file, copy the code of the game from this book by manually typing it yourself. (Don’t use copy and paste!)

3. Run the program again, and go back and fix any typos or bugs you may have introduced.

4. Run the program under a debugger, so you can carefully execute each line of code one at a time to understand what it does.

5. Find the comments marked with (!) to find code that you can modify and then see how this affects the program the next time you run it.

6. Finally, try to re-create the program yourself from scratch. It doesn’t have to be an exact copy; you can put your own spin on the program.

When copying the code from this book, you don’t necessarily have to type the comments (the text at the end of a line following the # symbol), as these are notes for human programmers and are ignored by Python.

However, try to write your Python code on the same line numbers as the programs in this book to make comparison between the two easier. If you have trouble finding typos in your program, you can compare your code to the code in this book with the online diff tool at https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/diff/.
